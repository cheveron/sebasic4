SE Basic IV includes over 12,000 lines of code, and if developed in a conventional proprietary way would have required many years of work and cost over $500,000.

It is developed as part of the firmware for the [Chloe 280SE](https://www.patreon.com/chloe280se), an open source hardware/software project as defined by the [Open Source Hardware Association](https://www.oshwa.org/) and the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/).
